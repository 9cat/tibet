# Contributors

Deploying immutable code to mainnet is always scary. Contributors built and reviewed this project in their free time, expecting nothing in return. Their mention here is just for thanking them and does not represent the approval of the company they're working at.

We did our best to make sure this project is secure, but no guarantees can be made.
