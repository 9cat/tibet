# Contributors

Building this kind of thing is not easy. Especially if you want it to be secure. Contributors write/review the code, make sure everything is ok, and provide suggestions for improvements. They are also responsible for emotional support.

While we did our best to make sure this piece of code is secure and reliable, please keep in mind that we are human beings that can make mistakes. As such, don't hold us liable if something goes wrong - we really tried to prevent it.
